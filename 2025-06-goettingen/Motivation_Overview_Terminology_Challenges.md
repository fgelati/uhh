- **Motivations**: Address inequality in digital corpora for non-English and marginalised languages.
- **Terminology**: Prefer “under-represented” over “under-resourced” to capture diversity (e.g., regional English, Chinese).
- **Challenges**:
  - Scarcity of digitised texts (OCR/HTR problems).
  - Linguistic diversity: dialects, non-Latin scripts.
  - Technical tool gaps & lack of benchmarks.
  - Ethical concerns (CARE), sustainability, and lack of funding.
